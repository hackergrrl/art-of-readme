## Evolution of README

>The basic **Idea** of README Evolution is centered around target audience.


Typically README files are a one-in-all kind of technical documentation.  Contemporary business demands
necessitate a more audience friendly document, which retains simplicity of README, yet offers information
in a more modular, optimal manner for better usability. This idea draws _inspiration_ from divio 
[here:](https://www.divio.com/en/blog/documentation/)

### Structured README

_Target Audience_
1. New users of the SW / Module / Project
2. Business Decision Makers
3. Technical Writers, Technology Marketeers

_Proposed Structure_

The following bullets could comprise the key pillars of a modern README.

* **One-liner** explaining the purpose of the module / Software
  * Necessary background context & links _(This could point to project/SW/product website)_
* **List** of potential use cases or pain points (one liners) that the software / module / product addresses.
* Names of **integration modules** or SW that is used in conjunction with this module. If more than 3, link to 
the document listing these elsewhere.
* **Deployment** instructions
  * Pre-requisites, 
  * Installation 
* Links to **speed-up onboarding**
  * Names and link to tutorials 
  * Index of names and links to respective how-to docs 
  * Link to troubleshooting guide 
  * _MUST-HAVE_ link to extensive API documentation or reference guide
* **Caveats & limitations** of using the software or module should be mentioned up-front. If there are more than 3, 
link to the limitations list/scenarios elsewhere.
* Comprehensive list of Names of projects / software (along with website links) that **consume** this module and can be referred to as case-studies
describing how this software was deployed in real life corresponding to one or more of the use cases listed in earlier bullets.
